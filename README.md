# The Proposed Charter Update
The proposed charter update for the PCE WG. 

The currently approved charter version is at [-07](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-pce/07/).

This repository is the place to track the possible update to the charter. The core discussion should happen on the [mailing list](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/pce). The final approval is done by the IESG using the data tracker.

A Google doc was used for the initial discussion between the chairs and AD and can be used to see the history. [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TlCQ5YMkliBoMOlICK9S6LLW_zEp3lX_yeNrJuU09SE/edit?usp=sharing)
