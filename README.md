# The Proposed Charter Update
The proposed charter update for the PCE WG is at [-08](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ietf-wg-pce/charter/main/charter-ietf-pce-08.txt).  

The currently approved charter version is at [-07](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-pce/07/). 

The diff can be seen [here](https://author-tools.ietf.org/iddiff?url1=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ietf-wg-pce/charter/main/charter-ietf-pce-07.txt&difftype=--html&url2=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ietf-wg-pce/charter/main/charter-ietf-pce-08.txt).

This repository is the place to track the possible update to the charter. The core discussion should happen on the [mailing list](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/pce). The final approval is done by the IESG using the data tracker.

A Google doc was used for the initial discussion between the chairs and AD and can be used to see the history. [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TlCQ5YMkliBoMOlICK9S6LLW_zEp3lX_yeNrJuU09SE/edit?usp=sharing)
